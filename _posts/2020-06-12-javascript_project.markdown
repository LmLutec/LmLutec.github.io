Overall, I enjoyed creating this project. My app was a horoscope app with an advice column added in. It took me a while to decide on my project idea. Once decided, I started on my backend, with one model and controller, then I created my frontend (css, index.html, index.js). Each time I created something on my backend, I created the corresponding code in the front end to ensure everything was coming together correctly. For me, I struggled with setting up cors and being able to fetch my api correctly. Once I was able to fetch the data, the challenge was getting my information to display on the index.html page the way I wanted it to. I spent most of my time during this project on css and the cors set up. The rest of the time, I was setting my code up different ways, seeing which way I wanted to render the data, for example, did I want to show each horoscope with all of their daily readings over time or just the current daily reading. I really enjoyed testing my code and seeing all the different animations or eventlisteners working. If I could do anything differently, I would have planned longer. It would have saved me a few days as I tossed my app and started over a couple of times.
