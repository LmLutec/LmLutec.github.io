My first project, CLI Data Gem, was challenging for me. I understood the concepts of scraping. I knew how to create methods, how to iterate. The most challenging part for me was getting the foundation of my app created. It took me quite a few days to get my project to the point where I could even begin to scrape my chosen website and see what the data was being returned as. I enjoyed this part of the project. I liked grabbing the data that I needed(author, book titles, release date, and summary) and manipulating the data so that it came out in a user-friendly format. I had to explore regex options and use methods such as .strip and .split as well. The regex was the most challenging part. I really enjoyed going back to my project every so often and retesting it. The top books for the week changes, obviously. But with each change, everything in my code still worked. If I could redo my experience with this project, I would panic less in the beginning and sit and think of the best methodical way to start the project. Once I knew what I wanted to scrape and how I wanted it be presented to users, the rest was not too difficult.
