For my Rails project, I decided to create a vacation review website. A user can create a profile or log in using Google, view other reviews, and create their own reviews. This project was challenging but it had a lot of moving parts. I enabled my users to have many reviews, have many locations through reviews, has many comments through reviews, and plenty more. I also struggled with setting up the Google login. I relied heavily on the learn curriculum and the Google developers console to troubleshoot through some hang ups. I enjoyed some of the tedious parts. I loved setting up helper methods, I may have used too many. Although it was challenging, I was very much excited about this project. It was like creating a huge puzzle.
