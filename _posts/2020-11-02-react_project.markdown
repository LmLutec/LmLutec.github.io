Working with React and Redux was fun. I started by building my own API with Rails, then created my react frontend. Creating the app itself was more tedious than anything. My struggle points included: links showing up on each page(when they were not supposed to), pages rerendering without any data, and deploying my site(using Netlify for my frontend and Heroku for my backend). This was my first time deploying my app and for me it was the most challenging. With a bit of research and the resources provided, I was able to get my apps deployed within a few hours. After deploying my apps, I now realize that it just seemed extremely difficult because it was new to me. I do not expect to have the same problems moving forward. I heavily relied up debuggers in my frontend. I used them mostly to see the way data was being fetch from the backend so that I could display correctly in the frontend. React router takes some practice as well. My overall approach for the project was to create my backend skeleton(without all the code), connect it to my frontend, and then build each model/controller action and test it. For instance, I started with the ability to create a new user from the frontend. Once I was able to create a user, I moved to being able to log a user in, then on to the user creating a food truck and etc.
