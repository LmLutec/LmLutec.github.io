For my Sinatra project, I created a Poetry slam. Poets create a profile(with password authentication for future logins), post original poems, edit/delete their own work, and view other poets' works. The MVC structure was pretty simple for me to understand so I did not struggle in that area. I did have some trouble arranging my routes or getting my routes to do what I needed them to. I had minor interpolating problems but my syntax was just incorrect. Getting my forms set up and sending information to the right path was tricky for me in the beginning. It took alot of troubleshooting, using pry, and viewing the pages to get my data set up the way I wanted it to be. I had my moments of frustration, but I found it helpful to step back for atleast thirty minutes, do something else for a bit, and then approach my challenge with fresh eyes. That always works for me. I enjoyed creating this project. I need more work with my css skills. I would have liked for my project to be stronger in respect to css.
