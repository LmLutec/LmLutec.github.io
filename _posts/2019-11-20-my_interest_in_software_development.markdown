I have always loved writing since I was in middle school. I would write short stories mostly. Over the years, my interest in technology grew. My grandfather owned his own technology business that touched on wiring configurations, software, and hardware so I was exposed to different aspects of technology. It took me a while to narrow down my interest in Software Development. The first time I seriously looked into Software Development was during my colleges course, an introduction course designed to prepare students for the A+ certification. There was a section on working within the terminal, viewing files on the system, changing passwords from the terminal, and more. It was exciting, for me, it was the most interesting part of the class. I started digging around on my own into coding, it was difficult for me. I had no experience and I was not sure if I was learning the concepts correctly. I was all over the place. The next semester, I took a HTML/CSS introduction course. This is when I realized that coding was something I wanted to do for a living. I was excited to create webpages and dictate their format/design with css. I looked up the page source of every website I went to for a while, just for fun. This is the first time that I have been passionate about a career choice. I knew I wanted to work with computers so I worked to get my Bachelor's degree but I did not feel passionate about my decision until I was drawn to Software Development. My passion continues to grow. I am excited about my future and I am excited about my learning journey.
