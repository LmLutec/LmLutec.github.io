I have enjoyed my overall experience with Flatiron. I like doing the labs, writing code, troubleshooting my code, and etc. I really enjoyed creating my projects. For me, one of the most challenging parts of creating each project was my planning process or lack of one. There were many times during a project where I would toss the whole app and start over or I would come up with another cool idea for my app and have to drop my database, recreate it, etc. By itself, that task is not a big deal. But I had a lot of little changes, changes that took a huge chunk of time in my coding process. Initially, I did not feel as though this was a big deal but as I neared the end of the curriculum, I started looking through previous projects. I wanted to update my code, add new functionalities, and things of that nature. I realized that parts of my code could have been more concise or that some of the methods I created were redundant as there were already solutions for that scenario. For my last project, I have planned extensively. I have not even started writing my code yet and I can already tell the difference. I appreciate my process as it has been invaluable. The only thing I would have done differently is spend more time planning. Planning is a necessary and efficient step.
